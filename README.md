# X Minutes Beep

Gnome extension that beeps every x minutes, just as a notification that a certain time has passed. Also keeps track of the total minutes passed since started. Kind of a reminder that you are spending this time on something.

Click on it to start.

Double click to stop.

For now tested only on Gnome 42 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
